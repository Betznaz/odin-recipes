        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Place steaks between 2 layers of plastic and pound
                to a thickness of 1/4 inch.</li>
            <li>
                Place 2 cups flour in a shallow bowl.</li>  
            <li>
                Stir together baking powder, baking soda, 1 tsp pepper,
                and 3/4 tsp salt in a second shallow bowl. Add buttermilk,
                Tabasco sauce, egg, and garlic; stir to combine.</li>
            <li>
                Heat shortening in a deep cast-iron skillet to 325 degrees F 
                (165 degrees C). Place a wire rack over a sheet of parchment paper.</li>
            <li>
                While the shortening is heating, dredge a steak in flour to 
                coat; shake off excess. Dip into buttermilk batter; lift up 
                so excess batter drips back into the bowl. Press in flour 
                again to coat both sides completely. Place breaded steak on 
                the wire rack and repeat to bread remaining steaks.</li>
            <li>Fry steaks, in batches if necessary, until evenly golden 
                brown, 3 to 5 minutes per side. Remove steaks to a paper 
                towel-lined plate to drain. Cover with foil to keep warm 
                while you make the gravy.</li>
            <li>
                Drain fat from the skillet, reserving 1/4 cup of the liquid 
                and as much of the solid remnants as possible.</li>
            <li>
                Return the skillet to medium-low heat; add the reserved oil. 
                Whisk the remaining 1/4 cup flour into the oil. Scrape the 
                bottom of the pan with a spatula to release solids into the gravy.</li>
            <li>
                Stir in milk, increase the heat to medium, and bring the 
                gravy to a simmer. Cook, stirring often, until thick, 
                6 to 7 minutes. Season with kosher salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>
                Transfer steaks to a platter and pour gravy over top.</li>
        </ol>
